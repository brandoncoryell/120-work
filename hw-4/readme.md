['Hello World!' Sketch](https://brandoncoryell.github.io/120-work/hw-3/)

## In Summary

This week I felt like I got a bit more of a taste of what the rest of the course will be like, obviously in a small dose. We went through some different types of code. Then we went into the basics of a function. Working with the function command, as little as we did this week, helped build on my excitement from week 2. Being able to see what you've created through a browser after it translates code that you've written makes it all feel a bit more real. From creating a circle to changing the dimensions of the cirle to altering the canvas that I was "drawing" the circle on, the content this week was very enjoyable to learn. The video about what p5.js is with Dan Shiffman was the hook line and sinker for me to start it off. Drawing lines as they made sounds with different pitches as you moved across the screen was a great way to introduce p5.js.

## How I completed the assignment & problems or issues.

The videos and text content throughout the module were very helpful for me in completing this assignment. What I found helpful was first watching Dr. Musick's videos to get a basic understanding of what I was trying to accomplish. After watching, I would then restart the video and go down the page to follow along as I could hear Dr. Musick talk and read and type at the same time. I had no problems or issues completing the homework, although I will say that when viewing my changes to the sketch file in a browser, I was forgetting to save at first and for a few minutes I was wondering what I could possibly be doing wrong.

## Conclusion

I can't wait to continue to learn about functions in coding and the variety of ways that a function can be used. It became apparent even more that coding is such a powerful form of expression. I am beginning to feel more and more comfortable working with the applications.
