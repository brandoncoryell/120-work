## In Summary

This week we were obviously given a bit more freedom to practice and play around with the basic functions of p5.js. I enjoyed getting into the different functions and being able to just learn by the process of trial and error. I had an idea of how I wanted my monster to look but my lack of experience with coding made it difficult to accurately portray that so it took me a much longer time than it should have for my end result.

## How I completed the assignment & problems or issues.

I watched a few videos that helped me get started and kind of get through the basic ideas that i would need. Also, I did alot of reading on the p5.js website in the references section to see exactly how the functions I was using worked and how I could go about manipulating them. Most of all, I just used trial and error, constantly typing in code, hitting Control-S and refresh to see if it worked. I did not have any issues other than not being able to control/manipulate my shapes as well as I would like to but I think that will come with more practice and learning.

## Conclusion

I'm finding it hard to contribute to the issues forum because I just don't have the knowledge. If I was to run into issue that I had to research to fix, maybe I would then be able to pass that information on. I will have to figure out other ways that I can make posts.
